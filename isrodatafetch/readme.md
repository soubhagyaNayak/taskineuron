This code is a JavaScript implementation of a simple web application that fetches data from an external API and displays it in the HTML document. The external API is hosted at https://isro.vercel.app and provides information about various aspects of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) including spacecrafts, launchers, customer satellites, and centres.

The code begins by defining four variables that correspond to links in the HTML document: spacecraftsLink, launchersLink, customerSatellitesLink, and centresLink. Each of these variables has an event listener attached to it that listens for a click event. When one of these links is clicked, the corresponding event listener is triggered.

Each event listener then makes a fetch request to the external API using the fetch() method. The URL for the API request is constructed using the BASE_URL variable and the appropriate endpoint for the data that is being requested (/api/spacecrafts, /api/launchers, /api/customer_satellites, or /api/centres).

Once the API response is received, the data is parsed as JSON using the response.json() method. The resulting data is then used to dynamically generate HTML elements that are appended to the resultsDiv element in the HTML document. The HTML elements are generated using template literals, which allow for easy insertion of data into the generated HTML.

For example, when the customerSatellitesLink is clicked, the code fetches data about customer satellites from the API, and then generates an HTML element for each customer satellite using a template literal. The template literal includes placeholders for the relevant data about the customer satellite, which are replaced with the actual data using string interpolation.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the fetch() method to retrieve data from an external API and how to dynamically generate HTML elements in response to that data.
