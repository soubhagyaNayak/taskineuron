This code is a JavaScript program that fetches and displays information about a GitHub user and their repositories using the GitHub API.

The program consists of several functions and event listeners:

getUser(username) is an async function that takes a GitHub username as an argument and fetches the user's information from the GitHub API. It then generates an HTML card with the user's name, bio, followers, following, and repository information. It calls the getRepos(username) function to fetch and display the user's repositories.
getRepos(username) is an async function that takes a GitHub username as an argument and fetches the user's repository information from the GitHub API. It then generates HTML links to each repository and appends them to the "repos" div element.
formSubmit() is a function that is called when the search box loses focus. If the search box is not empty, it calls the getUser(username) function with the search box value and clears the search box.
An event listener is added to the search box to call the formSubmit() function when the search box loses focus.
The program also includes some HTML elements with IDs that are used to display the fetched information:

main is a div element that displays the user's information card.
search is an input element that allows the user to search for a GitHub user.
The program uses the fetch() method to retrieve data from the GitHub API and the async/await syntax to handle asynchronous operations. It also uses string interpolation to dynamically generate HTML elements.
